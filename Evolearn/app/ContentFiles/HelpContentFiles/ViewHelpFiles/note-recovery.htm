<h2>Note Recovery</h2>
~~~~~~
<p>
  This is where you can recover notes that are no longer accessible, either
  because the document that contained them was removed, or the internal id of
  that document was changed.
</p>
<p>
  This view functions a lot like the normal notes view, but here if you delete
  all the available notes, you will no longer be able to access it, as there
  will be no more notes that need to be recovered.
</p>
<p>
  You can leave those notes in this view for as long as you like, or you can
  copy their contents over to the clip board and then paste them in a file
  (preferably one with an html extension, in order for the markup to render
  properly), or a new note in one of the available documents.
</p>
<p>
  If for what ever reason the previously removed document becomes available
  again, this view will not be accessible any longer, as you will be able to
  access all your notes the normal way, through the pdf view.
