~~~~~~

<p>Here you will find all of the notifications send by the Teacher.</p>

<p>
  You have the ability to clear all current notifications by clicking
  <button
    class="remove_all_button btn btn-primary d-flex align-content-center m-2"
  >
    <span>Remove All Notifications</span>
    <span class="material-icons ps-2"> delete_forever </span>
  </button>
  or fetch all available notification from the server, assuming of course that
  you have a working connection to said server by clicking
  <button
    class="get_all_button btn btn-primary d-flex align-content-center m-2"
  >
    <span>Get All Notifications</span>
    <span class="material-icons ps-2"> file_download </span>
  </button>
</p>

<p>
  When you have notifications, they are ordered from newest to oldest.<br />
  If you missed any notifications, you will see a counter in the notifications
  section of the menu. <br />
  When you click on notifications, you will see all the missed notifications
  covered by a green border, which means that they are <q>unseen</q>. <br />
  Next time you open the notifications view they will lose the green border,
  which means that they are now <q>seen</q>. <br />
  By clicking on the notification you can get to see how it would look if you
  had just received it. <br />
  You can delete a specific notification by clicking
  <button
    class="remove_notification btn btn-primary d-flex align-items-center m-2"
  >
    Delete Notification <span class="material-icons ms-2">delete</span>
  </button>
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  You also have the ability to not show a modal window any time you receive a
  new notification by enabling
  <i role="button" onclick="changeView('settings')">Do Not Disturb Mode</i> in
  the settings. <br />
  In this mode, any new notifications will be saved here as <q>seen</q> and the
  notification counter in the menu will show how many you received.
