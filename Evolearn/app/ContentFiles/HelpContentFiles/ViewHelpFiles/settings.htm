<h2>Settings</h2>
~~~~~~
<p>
  Here is where you can tweak some aspects of the application to better suit you
  needs.
</p>
<p>
  For some settings the change is instant, for some others you can click on the
  appropriate test buttons to see the settings change.

<h4>Exporting and Importing</h4>
<p>
  When you click on
  <button class="export_settings btn btn-primary d-flex align-items-center m-2">
    Export<span class="material-icons ps-2">file_upload</span>
  </button>
  all the application data will be saved to the clipboard.<br />
  You can then save the contents of that clipboard by pasting them inside a text
  file with the use of a text editor.<br />
  When you are ready to import them on another computer or another browser on
  the same computer you can click on
  <button class="import_settings btn btn-primary d-flex align-items-center m-2">
    Import<span class="material-icons ps-2">file_download</span>
  </button>
  and then paste the file contents that you copied inside the textfield and
  click Import.<br />
  Please note that this action will override any existing data that you might
  have had saved previously, so be careful.
</p>
<hr />
<h4>Deletion and Reset</h4>
<p>
  When you click on
  <button class="delete_data btn btn-primary d-flex align-items-center m-2">
    Delete<span class="material-icons ps-2">delete</span>
  </button>
  you will get a modal window warning you that this action can not be undone,
  and that you have to be extra care full, cause if you go through with this
  action you will delete EVERYTHING stored in the application.<br />
  It will revert back to how it was when you first started it.<br />
  <br />
  On the other hand, clicking on
  <button class="reset_settings btn btn-primary d-flex align-items-center m-2">
    Reset Settings <span class="material-icons ps-2">restart_alt</span>
  </button>
  will just reset the settings values back to the factory defaults, without deleting any
  other application data such as, notes, goals, bookmarks, as well as any
  progression in the exercises and the quizzes.
